            <h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
            <p class="text">
            <ul>
                <li>Your internship officially begins on the start date mentioned in your Offer Letter email. You should
                    start
                    completing your tasks only after your internship has begun. Focus solely on the tasks within your
                    designated
                    domain as specified in your Offer Letter.</li>
                <br>
                <li>To be eligible for the Completion Certificate, you must complete at least two tasks in your
                    internship track. The
                    internship is self-paced, so you can work according to your own schedule.</li>
                <br>
                <li>You have the freedom to select your own learning resources to study and complete the tasks. Note
                    that no
                    formal training will be provided during the internship. Utilize online tutorials, courses, and other
                    educational
                    materials that best suit your learning style.</li>
                <br>
                <li> You are required to maintain a public GitHub repository for all the tasks you complete. Use the
                    following naming
                    convention for your repositories: "FutureIntern_TaskNumber". For example, if you are a Web
                    Development intern
                    working on your second task, name your repository <b>"FutureIntern_WD_02"</b>.</li>
                <br>
                <li> After completing each task, you must create a LinkedIn post outlining the task you have completed
                    and the
                    knowledge you gained. Optionally, you can include a video in your post. Mention Future Intern in
                    your post and
                    use the specified hashtags to ensure visibility.</li>
                <br>
                <li> You will receive the Task Submission Form via email around the middle of your internship month. Use
                    this form
                    to submit links to your completed tasks. Ensure that your submissions are thorough and accurately
                    reflect your
                    work.</li>
                <br>
                <li> You are free to choose any programming language or framework to complete your tasks. For Data
                    Science
                    interns, tools like MS Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and Google Sheets are recommended.</li>
                <br>
                <li> Throughout your internship, we will be in constant contact with you to provide guidance and
                    support. If you
                    encounter any problems or have questions, do not hesitate to reach out to us. We are here to help
